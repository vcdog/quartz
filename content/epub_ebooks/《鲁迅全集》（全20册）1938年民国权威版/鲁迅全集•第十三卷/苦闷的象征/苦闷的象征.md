厨川白村 作

  

The colours of his mind seemed yet unworn；  

For the wild language of his grief was high，

Such as in measure were called poetry.

And I remember one remark which then Maddalo made.

He said:“Most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong；

They learn in suffering what they teach in song.”

  

—Shelley，Julian and Maddalo.
